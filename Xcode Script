Witnessing the mesmerizing nature of the brain and realizing the many unknowns that are in our current scope of knowledge regarding this vital organ secured my decision to enter a career in the neurosciences for my future. I attended medical school at the Mercer University School of Medicine in Savannah, Georgia. Throughout my medical training, I was involved with several clinical projects in all aspects of the neurosciences, and I realized I wanted a career where I could further the knowledge with respect to diseases that often have grim prognoses for patients today. During my time in medical school, I also became interested in biomedical device development. Since graduating school, I have been completing a Masters in Applied Biomedical Engineering at the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering while becoming involved in the Neuro-Oncology Surgical Outcomes Laboratory at Johns Hopkins. Here, I participate in a variety of projects aimed at improving outcomes after surgery for brain cancers. Additionally, I am also devising projects of applying machine learning algorithms to enhance clinical decision-making capabilities in medicine and also to aid in prognostication of medical diseases.")

So far, my interest in neuroscience and neurosurgery has grown more than I could have ever expected, as I have been lucky to receive guidance from outstanding mentors who continue to light the fire of discovery within me. In neurosurgery, I hope to combine my love for healing people with my passion for understanding the human brain, and my greatest dream is to improve the quality of life of people from all backgrounds while engaging in the most cutting-edge research in neuroscience. Additionally, I hope that skills learned in my MBA program will allow me to make meaningful contributions in the field as much of the United States healthcare is greatly dictated by financial considerations.")
